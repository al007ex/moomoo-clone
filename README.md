# MooMoo.io Clone

Fully working MooMoo.io private server

## Project structure
- `client/` Webpack-powered front-end source and static assets.
- `server/` Game server source (ES modules) and dependencies.
- `dist/` Build artifacts generated by the client build (ignored by git).

## Getting started
1. Install workspace dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the web client into `dist/client`:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the game server (serves the bundled client and WebSocket API):
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Use `npm run build:dev` while iterating on the client for an auto-rebuilt bundle, or `npm run dev` to run the server in development mode.
